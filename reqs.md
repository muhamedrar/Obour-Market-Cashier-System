🗄️ DATABASE MODELS
1️⃣ Suppliers
id (PK)
date
supplier_name
fruit_name
units_count
remaining_units
class_number
price_per_unit
total_price
notes
is_cleared (boolean)

Business logic:

Decrease remaining_units after each sale
Auto mark is_cleared = True when remaining_units = 0
2️⃣ Retail Transactions
id (PK)
date
fruit_name
units_count
class_number
price_per_unit
commission_per_unit
admin_expense
total_price
final_price = total_price + (commission * units) + admin_expense
notes
3️⃣ Special Retailers (Debt + Installments)
id (PK)
date
retailer_name
fruit_name
units_count
class_number
price_per_unit
total_price
total_paid (default 0)
remaining_balance = total_price - total_paid
status = unpaid / partial / paid
notes
4️⃣ Payments
id (PK)
retailer_id (FK → special_retailers.id)
payment_date
amount_paid
notes

Logic:

total_paid += amount_paid
remaining_balance = total_price - total_paid
Update status based on remaining_balance
5️⃣ Expenses
id (PK)
date
expense_name
amount

Logic:

Deduct all expenses from revenue
6️⃣ Settings
id
company_name
phone_number
commission_per_unit
admin_expense
admin_password (hashed)
